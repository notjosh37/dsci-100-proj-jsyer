    "### Quick Tips for Full Credit\n",
    "1. **Reproducibility first** – verify the notebook runs cleanly on a fresh kernel.  \n",
    "2. **Clean narrative flow** – Markdown should lead the reader logically from question → data → analysis → conclusion.  \n",
    "3. **Figure polish** – meaningful titles, labeled axes, readable legends.  \n",
    "4. **Model justification** – state assumptions, show validation metrics, acknowledge limitations.  \n",
    "5. **Commit early & often** – document your process in Git."
